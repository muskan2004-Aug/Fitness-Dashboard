🏋️‍♂️ Fitness Analytics Dashboard
📌 Project Overview

A Power BI dashboard designed to analyze both the business performance and fitness insights of a gym. It provides a 360° view of revenue, expenses, memberships, and even individual health metrics like BMI and calorie requirements.

🎯 Purpose

The goal of this project is to leverage data visualization for:

Tracking business performance (profitability, expenses, revenue trends).

Monitoring member engagement (active vs expired, membership categories).

Offering health insights (BMI index, calorie calculator).

Helping gym owners make data-driven decisions.

🛠️ Tech Stack

Power BI → Data modeling, visualization, and DAX measures

Excel → Source dataset preparation

Figma → Custom background design

DAX → Calculated columns, measures, and KPIs

📂 Data Source

Dataset exported from Excel workshop (sample gym dataset with members, revenue, expenses, and activity data).

✨ Features & Highlights
🔹 Business Insights

Yearly and monthly Revenue vs Expenses vs Profit analysis.

Highlighted highest profit month (Nov) and lowest profit month (April).

Membership breakdown by Platinum, Gold, Silver and their active/expired status.

Member joining trends (Nov = highest joining, March = lowest).

🔹 Health Insights

BMI Calculator to categorize members (underweight, healthy, overweight).

Calorie Calculator based on age, weight, and activity level.

Insights into BMR, TDEE, maintenance calories, mild weight loss, and extreme weight loss.

🔹 Dashboard Goals

Provide a single platform to track both business and health metrics.

Enable gym owners to monitor financial performance and understand member behavior.

📊 Business Problem Addressed

Many gyms struggle with tracking performance and member engagement in a structured way. Data is often scattered in Excel sheets or managed manually. This dashboard brings all insights together, improving decision-making and transparency.

🚀 Future Improvements

Adding predictive analytics (forecasting revenue/memberships).

Automating data refresh with live databases.

Integrating advanced health metrics.
